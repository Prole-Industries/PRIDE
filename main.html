        <p>
            Lansing, sleepless.<br>
            Is this what you want<br>
            or is this all you've got?<br>
            You'll stray, and I'll pray<br>
            but this is what you want<br>
            'cause this is all we've got.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Fade to the background<br>
            and everything blurs all around<br>
            it's nothing to write home about<br>
            and I'm always getting down<br>
            will you wait for me now?<br>
            Will everything turn out?<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            The old armoire lyric<br>
            we're sewing seams and sharing spirits<br>
            and I can barely hear it<br>
            'cause everyone was overheated and I'll sway.<br>
            These mannequins are looking homely<br>
            and I'm feeling a little lonely<br>
            fumbling with my house keys;<br>
            the city's been hard on me.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Lansing, sleepless.<br>
            Is this what you want<br>
            or is this all you've got?<br>
            You'll stray, and I'll pray<br>
            but this is what you want<br>
            'cause this is all we've got.<br>
        </p>
